    "Of course the values in our list don't have to be numbers. Let's take a look at a very common problem: pretty excerpt texts. To display the intro of a blog post on the overview page, you only have a certain amount of characters of space. But you don't want to hard-break at that count, as you might be in the middle of a word. Instead you want to have a smart `word_wrapper` function, which given a string of words and the maximum total of characters you have space for, it will return a string that nicely breaks at the latest word before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: There is a beautiful recursive solution to this. To break a string into a list of strings of words use `string.slit()` and to combine a list of words back into a nice string with spaces in between use `' '.join(list_of_words)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Challenge**: Restructure the code to be able to add another method `make_headline`, which re-uses the same recursive function to enforce its 20 character rule, but title-cases the words before concattenating them back into a nice string. _Hint_: python has some great [String-Transformation methods](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods) to help you with it."
