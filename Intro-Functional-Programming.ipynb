    "#What Functional Programming Is All About\n",
    "Functional programming is getting a lot of attention and with it comes a lot of confusion. \n",
    "What is functional programming all about? The answer is not recursion, or currying, or pattern matching. It's not about monads or functors. So, if those concepts sound alien to you, fear not. Those are just design patterns and language features that make it easier to program in a functional way. Similarly, functional languages tend to have certain characteristics that make them especially suitable for functional programming, like treating functions as first class citizen. \n",

    "But you do not have to learn Haskell to write functional code. What differentiates a functional code from a non-functional code is not the language it is written in, it's the fact that it's **stateless - there are no side-effects**."

For starters, the official Python docs have an excellent – though dry – ['how to'](https://docs.python.org/dev/howto/functional.html) we can recommend you look at. Among others it will dive into the [itertools module](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/itertools.html#module-itertools), which we'll also touch on in the [UFO challenge](./Challenges/UFO Data.ipynb) already. Furhtermore, it will introduce the [functools](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/functools.html#module-functools) and the [operator](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/operator.html#module-operator) modules, which allow for some awesome composition and declerative code writing in python."
