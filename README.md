#Welcome to Func-Starters
To get this working, download [iPython](http://ipython.org/install.html) and notebook. 
For anyone who has pip, it's as simple as typing in:
```python
pip install "ipython[notebook]"
```
and hitting Enter.

Then clone this repo and cd into the project. From there, simply run:

```python
ipython notebook
```

The notebooks should open in your browser. The tutorial, exercises and solutions each have their own notebook!
